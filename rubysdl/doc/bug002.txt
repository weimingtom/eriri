caused by overflowing an c array

		char file_content[2048]= {0};
		ruby_jni_callback_readfile(fname, file_content, sizeof(file_content));
		rb_compile_string(fname, rb_str_new2(file_content), 1);
		
2048 is too small, 
but this is OK when running under Windows,
It's hard to find the reason of this problem.

modifying this code and use calloc instead.
